# Create Service Account Workspace Member

`$ ant organization:workspaces:service-accounts add`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=cli).

Add a service account to a workspace with the given `workspace_role`.

The role determines what the service account can do in the workspace and
which workspace-scoped permissions it can be granted when authenticating
through federation. Every service account is already an implicit
`workspace_user` member of the default workspace; adding it explicitly
assigns a chosen role. If the service account is already an explicit
member of the workspace, its `workspace_role` is replaced with the
value supplied here. Archived workspaces return 400. Archived service
accounts cannot be added and are rejected.

## Parameters

- `--workspace-id: string` (path parameter)

  ID of the workspace.

- `--service-account-id: string`

  Tagged service account ID to add.

- `--workspace-role: NoBillingWorkspaceRole`

  Role to assign to the service account in this workspace.

  - `"workspace_admin"`

  - `"workspace_developer"`

  - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

  - `"workspace_user"`

## Returns

- `service_account_workspace_member: object`

  - `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

  - `created_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

  - `implicit: boolean`

    True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role `workspace_user` and cannot be removed.

  - `service_account_id: string`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

  - `workspace_id: string`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

  - `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_billing" or "workspace_developer" or 2 more`

    Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

    - `"workspace_admin"`

    - `"workspace_billing"`

    - `"workspace_developer"`

    - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

    - `"workspace_user"`

## Example

```bash
ant organization:workspaces:service-accounts add \
  --workspace-id workspace_id \
  --service-account-id service_account_id \

```
