# List Workspaces For Service Account

`$ ant organization:service-accounts:workspaces list`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=cli).

List the workspaces a service account is a member of.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role` in that
workspace. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. When the
service account has no explicit default-workspace membership, the
implicit (`implicit: true`) membership is returned as the first entry on
the first page; with `limit=1` the first page may return up to 2 entries
(the implicit entry plus one explicit membership) so a pagination cursor
can be derived. Memberships are returned only while
the service account is active. Without a `page` cursor, an archived
service account returns an empty list. A `page` cursor that does not
match an active membership returns a 400 invalid-request error. A cursor
stops matching when the membership is removed, the workspace is deleted,
or the service account is archived. Restart pagination from the first
page to recover.

## Parameters

- `--service-account-id: string` (path parameter)

  ID of the service account.

- `--limit: optional number` (query parameter)

  Number of results per page.

  minimum: 1, maximum: 100

- `--page: optional string` (query parameter)

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

## Returns

- `ServiceAccountWorkspaceMemberListResponse: object`

  - `data: array of ServiceAccountWorkspaceMember`

    - `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

    - `created_by_actor_id: string`

      Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

    - `implicit: boolean`

      True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role `workspace_user` and cannot be removed.

    - `service_account_id: string`

      Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

    - `workspace_id: string`

      Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

    - `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_billing" or "workspace_developer" or 2 more`

      Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

      - `"workspace_admin"`

      - `"workspace_billing"`

      - `"workspace_developer"`

      - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

      - `"workspace_user"`

  - `next_page: string`

    Opaque cursor for the next page, or null if no more results.

## Example

```bash
ant organization:service-accounts:workspaces list \
  --service-account-id service_account_id
```

### Response (200)

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "created_by_actor_id": "created_by_actor_id",
