# Service Accounts

## Create Service Account

`organization.service_accounts.create(**kwargs) -> ServiceAccount`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=python).

Create a service account.

A service account is a named workload identity that federation rules
target. `organization_role` is `developer` (default) or `admin`; a rule
may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when the
target's `organization_role` is `admin`. Creating an `admin`-role service
account requires an interactive credential (a user OAuth token or a
Console session) — a workload may only create `developer`-role service
accounts.

### Parameters

- `name: str`

  Slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

  minLength: 1, maxLength: 255

- `description: Optional[str]`

  Optional free-text description.

  maxLength: 2000

- `organization_role: Optional[Literal["admin", "developer"]]`

  Org-level role. Defaults to `developer`.

  - `"admin"`

  - `"developer"`

### Returns

- `class ServiceAccount`

  Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

  A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
  whatever references it (federation rules).

  - `type: Literal["service_account"]`

    default: service_account

  - `id: str`

    Tagged ID of the service account.

  - `archived_at: Optional[datetime]`

    If set, this service account is archived.

    format: date-time

  - `archived_by_actor_id: Optional[str]`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this service account.

  - `created_at: datetime`

    When this service account was created.

    format: date-time

  - `created_by_actor_id: Optional[str]`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this service account.

  - `description: Optional[str]`

    Optional free-text description.

  - `name: str`

    Admin-chosen slug identifier.

  - `organization_role: Literal["admin", "developer"]`

    Org-level role. A federation rule may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when this is `admin`. A rule granting `org:admin` whose target is later demoted to `developer` is rejected at token exchange. Rules granting `org:admin` are managed in the Console.

    - `"admin"`

    - `"developer"`

  - `updated_at: datetime`

    When this service account was last updated.

    format: date-time

  - `updated_by_actor_id: Optional[str]`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this service account.

Mirror of `POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`, addressed
from the service-account side; both create the same membership. If the
service account is already an explicit member of the workspace, its

    - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

    - `"workspace_user"`

#### Example

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
service_account_workspace_member = client.organization.service_accounts.workspaces.add(
    service_account_id="service_account_id",
    workspace_id="workspace_id",
    workspace_role="workspace_admin",
)
print(service_account_workspace_member.created_by_actor_id)
```

##### Response (200)

```json
{
  "created_by_actor_id": "created_by_actor_id",
  "implicit": true,
  "service_account_id": "service_account_id",
  "type": "service_account_workspace_member",

  "workspace_role": "workspace_admin"
}
```

### List Workspaces For Service Account

`organization.service_accounts.workspaces.list(service_account_id, **kwargs) -> SyncPageCursor[ServiceAccountWorkspaceMember]`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=python).

List the workspaces a service account is a member of.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role` in that
workspace. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. When the
service account has no explicit default-workspace membership, the
implicit (`implicit: true`) membership is returned as the first entry on
the first page; with `limit=1` the first page may return up to 2 entries
(the implicit entry plus one explicit membership) so a pagination cursor
can be derived. Memberships are returned only while
the service account is active. Without a `page` cursor, an archived
service account returns an empty list. A `page` cursor that does not
match an active membership returns a 400 invalid-request error. A cursor
stops matching when the membership is removed, the workspace is deleted,
or the service account is archived. Restart pagination from the first
page to recover.

#### Parameters

- `service_account_id: str` (path parameter)

  ID of the service account.

- `limit: Optional[int]` (query parameter)

  Number of results per page.

  default: 20, minimum: 1, maximum: 100

- `page: Optional[str]` (query parameter)

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

#### Returns

- `class ServiceAccountWorkspaceMember`

  - `type: Literal["service_account_workspace_member"]`

    default: service_account_workspace_member

  - `created_by_actor_id: Optional[str]`

    Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

  - `implicit: Optional[bool]`

    True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role `workspace_user` and cannot be removed.

  - `service_account_id: str`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

  - `workspace_id: str`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

  - `workspace_role: WorkspaceRole`

    Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

    - `"workspace_admin"`

    - `"workspace_billing"`

    - `"workspace_developer"`

    - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

    - `"workspace_user"`

#### Example

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
page = client.organization.service_accounts.workspaces.list(
    service_account_id="service_account_id",
)
page = page.data[0]
print(page.created_by_actor_id)
```

##### Response (200)

```json

  "data": [
    {
      "created_by_actor_id": "created_by_actor_id",
      "implicit": true,
      "service_account_id": "service_account_id",

### Remove Workspace From Service Account

`organization.service_accounts.workspaces.remove(workspace_id, **kwargs) -> WorkspaceRemoveResponse`

**DELETE** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces/{workspace_id}`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api?sdk_languages=python).

Remove a service account from a workspace.

Mirror of `DELETE /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`,
addressed from the service-account side. Removal is idempotent (returns
200 even if the membership was already removed). A DELETE against the
implicit default-workspace membership returns 200 but is a no-op and the
membership persists; deleting an explicit default-workspace row reverts
to the implicit `workspace_user` membership. Archived workspaces return
400.

#### Parameters

- `service_account_id: str` (path parameter)

  ID of the service account.

- `workspace_id: str` (path parameter)

  ID of the workspace.

#### Returns

- `class WorkspaceRemoveResponse`

  - `type: Literal["service_account_workspace_member_deleted"]`

    default: service_account_workspace_member_deleted

  - `service_account_id: str`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`) named in the delete request. Removal is idempotent; see the endpoint description for the implicit-membership no-op.

  - `workspace_id: str`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`) named in the delete request.

#### Example

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    ),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
workspace = client.organization.service_accounts.workspaces.remove(
    workspace_id="workspace_id",
    service_account_id="service_account_id",
)
print(workspace.service_account_id)
```

##### Response (200)

```json
{
  "service_account_id": "service_account_id",
  "type": "service_account_workspace_member_deleted",
  "workspace_id": "workspace_id"
}
```
