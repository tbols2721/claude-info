# Deny Spend Limit Increase Request

`organization.spend_limits.increase_requests.deny(spend_limit_increase_request_id, **kwargs) -> SpendLimitIncreaseRequest`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{spend_limit_increase_request_id}/deny`

Deny a pending spend limit increase request.

Idempotent on `denied`; denying an already-`approved` request returns
400. Anthropic emails the requester unless `suppress_notification` is set.

## Parameters

- `spend_limit_increase_request_id: str` (path parameter)

  ID of the spend limit increase request.

- `suppress_notification: Optional[bool]`

## Returns

- `class SpendLimitIncreaseRequest`

  - `type: Literal["spend_limit_increase_request"]`

    default: spend_limit_increase_request

  - `id: str`

  - `actor: SpendLimitIncreaseRequestActor`

    Who submitted the increase request.

    - `class SpendLimitUserActor`

      A user within the organization. `name` and `email_address` are
      null when the underlying account is unavailable or has been deleted;
      `deleted` is true only for deleted accounts.

      - `type: Literal["user_actor"]`

        Actor type. Always `user_actor`.

        default: user_actor

      - `deleted: bool`

        True only when the underlying account has been deleted.

        default: false

      - `email_address: Optional[str]`

        The user's email address. Null when the account is unavailable or has been deleted.

      - `name: Optional[str]`

        The user's current display name. Null when the account is unavailable, has been deleted, or has no name set.

      - `user_id: str`

        Tagged ID of the user.

    - `class SpendLimitScopedAPIKeyActor`

      A scoped Admin API key acting on behalf of the organization.

      - `type: Literal["scoped_api_key_actor"]`

        default: scoped_api_key_actor

      - `scoped_api_key_id: str`

  - `created_at: datetime`

    format: date-time

  - `period: SpendLimitPeriod`

    - `"daily"`

    - `"monthly"`

    - `"weekly"`

  - `resolved_at: Optional[datetime]`

    format: date-time

  - `resolved_by: Optional[SpendLimitIncreaseRequestResolvedBy]`

    Who approved or denied the increase request.

    - `class SpendLimitUserActor`

      A user within the organization. `name` and `email_address` are
      null when the underlying account is unavailable or has been deleted;
      `deleted` is true only for deleted accounts.

    - `class SpendLimitScopedAPIKeyActor`

      A scoped Admin API key acting on behalf of the organization.

  - `spend_summary: Optional[SpendSummary]`

    Per-member effective-limit report row (`GET /spend_limits/effective`).

    - `actor: Actor`

      - `class SpendLimitUserActor`

        A user within the organization. `name` and `email_address` are
        null when the underlying account is unavailable or has been deleted;
        `deleted` is true only for deleted accounts.

      - `class SpendLimitScopedAPIKeyActor`

        A scoped Admin API key acting on behalf of the organization.

    - `amount: Optional[str]`

      Effective limit amount as a non-negative integer decimal string in the minor unit of `currency` (cents for USD). `null` means no limit applies for this row's `period` — each period resolves independently, so another period may still cap this member.

    - `currency: str`

      ISO 4217 code of the organization's billing currency; the unit for `amount` and `period_to_date_spend`.

    - `period: SpendLimitPeriod`

      Period this row's effective limit and spend are reported for.

    - `period_to_date_spend: str`

      The member's spend so far in the current period, as a non-negative decimal string in the minor unit of `currency` (cents for USD). May carry fractional minor units up to three decimal places (e.g. `"12050.5"`) — metered usage is not rounded to whole cents. Reads as `"0"` when the spend reading is temporarily unavailable.

    - `scope: Scope`

      - `class SpendLimitUserScope`

        Scope selecting a single member of the organization.

        - `type: Literal["user"]`

        - `type: Literal["organization_service"]`

          default: organization_service

        - `service: str`

        Scope of the monthly spend cap Anthropic sets for a Claude Console
        organization from its usage tier, or a higher cap Anthropic granted the
        organization. Read-only; its `created_at` and `updated_at` are the
        organization's creation time, so `amount` can change while `updated_at` stays
        the same.

        - `type: Literal["usage_tier"]`

          Scope type. Always `usage_tier` for this scope.

      - `class SpendLimitUsageTierScope`

        Scope of the monthly spend cap Anthropic sets for a Claude Console
        organization from its usage tier, or a higher cap Anthropic granted the
        organization. Read-only; its `created_at` and `updated_at` are the
        organization's creation time, so `amount` can change while `updated_at` stays
        the same.

  - `status: SpendLimitIncreaseRequestStatus`

    - `"approved"`

    - `"denied"`
