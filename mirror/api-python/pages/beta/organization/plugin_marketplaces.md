# Plugin Marketplaces

## List Plugin Marketplaces

`beta.organization.plugin_marketplaces.list(**kwargs) -> SyncPageCursor[BetaPluginMarketplace]`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/plugin_marketplaces`

List the plugin marketplaces Plugins live in, newest first: the organization's own
and its members' personal ones.

Plugin marketplaces are created, connected to a repository and deleted in
claude.ai, not through this API. The organization's library marketplace, the
organization-owned `manual` marketplace that uploads go to when no marketplace is
named, is created the first time something is put in it and is listed from then on.

**Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `read:plugins` or `read:org_audit` scope, or a Compliance Access Key with the `read:compliance_org_data` scope.

Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.

### Parameters

- `limit: Optional[int]` (query parameter)

  Number of items to return per page.

  Defaults to `20`. Ranges from `1` to `1000`.

  default: 20, minimum: 1, maximum: 1000

- `organization_id: Optional[str]` (query parameter)

  For a `read:org_audit` or `read:compliance_org_data` key created for all of a parent organization's linked organizations: a child organization of that parent to read instead of the organization the key was created in, given as the organization's UUID or its `org_`-prefixed ID. A value that is neither returns a 400; an organization that is not a child of the key's parent, or where the Plugins API is not available, returns a 404. Any other key may pass only its own organization's ID here; another organization returns a 404.

- `owner_type: Optional[Literal["organization", "user"]]` (query parameter)

  `organization` for the organization's plugin marketplaces, `user` for members' personal plugin marketplaces.

  - `"organization"`

  - `"user"`

- `page: Optional[str]` (query parameter)

  Optionally set to the `next_page` token from the previous response.

  maxLength: 2048

- `source: Optional[Literal["directory", "github", "gitlab", 2 more]]` (query parameter)

  Only plugin marketplaces with this `source`: `manual` for those whose Plugins are uploaded; `github`, `gitlab` or `public_git` for those synchronized from a Git repository. `directory` (Anthropic's catalog) is never listed here.

  - `"directory"`

  - `"github"`

  - `default_installation_preference: Optional[Literal["auto_install", "available", "not_available", "required"]]`

    Organization plugin marketplace: the organization-wide setting every Plugin in it with no setting of its own gets. Null for a member's personal plugin marketplace. One of `required`, `auto_install`, `available`, `not_available`; a value this API does not yet name is returned as stored.

    - `"not_available"`

    - `"required"`

  - `last_sync_ended_at: Optional[datetime]`

    format: date-time

  - `last_sync_read_sha: Optional[str]`

    The commit the last synchronization attempt that reached the repository read, whether or not its content was then accepted (see `sync_status`); an attempt that ends `failed_auth` or `failed_transient` leaves it unchanged.

A value this API does not yet name is returned as stored.

    - `"directory"`

    - `"github"`

    - `"gitlab"`

    - `"manual"`

    - `"public_git"`

  - `sync_status: Optional[Literal["failed_auth", "failed_content", "failed_limits", 3 more]]`

**GET** `/v1/organizations/plugin_marketplaces/{marketplace_id}`

Retrieve a plugin marketplace by ID.

**Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `read:plugins` or `read:org_audit` scope, or a Compliance Access Key with the `read:compliance_org_data` scope.

## Update Plugin Marketplace

`beta.organization.plugin_marketplaces.update(marketplace_id, **kwargs) -> BetaPluginMarketplace`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/plugin_marketplaces/{marketplace_id}`

Set the default installation setting of one of the organization's own plugin
marketplaces. Every Plugin in it without a setting of its own gets this default as
its organization-wide setting, including Plugins added later.

Pass it as `default_installation_preference`. A member's personal marketplace
cannot be updated here (403).

**Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `write:plugins` scope.

Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only.

### Parameters

- `marketplace_id: str` (path parameter)

  ID of the plugin marketplace (prefixed `marketplace_`).

- `default_installation_preference: Literal["auto_install", "available", "not_available", "required"]`

  - `last_sync_ended_at: Optional[datetime]`

    RFC 3339. When the most recent synchronization attempt to finish did so, whatever its outcome; for a repository plugin marketplace no synchronization has run on yet, when it was created. Null for a plugin marketplace that is not synchronized from a repository.

    format: date-time

  - `last_sync_read_sha: Optional[str]`

    The commit the last synchronization attempt that reached the repository read, whether or not its content was then accepted (see `sync_status`); an attempt that ends `failed_auth` or `failed_transient` leaves it unchanged. Null until an attempt has first read the repository, and for a plugin marketplace that is not synchronized from a repository.

  - `name: str`

    Fixed for the plugin marketplace's lifetime.

  - `owner: Owner`

    The organization, or the member whose personal plugin marketplace it is.

    - `class BetaPluginOwnerOrganization`

      - `type: Literal["organization"]`

        The Plugin lives in a plugin marketplace the organization owns.

        default: organization

    - `class BetaPluginOwnerUser`

      - `type: Literal["user"]`

        The Plugin lives in one member's personal plugin marketplace.

        default: user

      - `user_id: str`

        The member's User ID.

  - `source: Literal["directory", "github", "gitlab", 2 more]`

    Where the plugin marketplace's Plugins come from: `manual` when they are uploaded; `github`, `gitlab` or `public_git` when they are synchronized from the Git repository the owner connected, into which nothing can be uploaded; `directory` is Anthropic's own catalog, which this API does not list. A value this API does not yet name is returned as stored.

    - `"gitlab"`

    - `"manual"`

    - `"public_git"`

  - `sync_status: Optional[Literal["failed_auth", "failed_content", "failed_limits", 3 more]]`

    Outcome of the plugin marketplace's most recent synchronization: one of `success`, `in_progress`, `failed_content`, `failed_transient`, `failed_auth`, `failed_limits`; a value this API does not yet name is returned as stored. Null until a synchronization is first attempted — so always for a `manual` plugin marketplace.

## Validate Plugin Marketplace Repository

`beta.organization.plugin_marketplaces.validate_repository(**kwargs) -> BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationReport`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/plugin_marketplaces/validate_repository`

Check whether a plugin marketplace held in a public GitHub repository would
synchronize into claude.ai, without connecting or storing it.

To check a `.zip` of the marketplace directory instead, use Validate Plugin Marketplace Archive.

The report says whether `marketplace.json` is well-formed, which plugins a
synchronization would skip and why, and which plugins would synchronize only in
part, with some files left out. A repository that is missing, private, or has no such branch or commit is reported, not refused: the response is a report with `valid: false`. Plugin sources outside the marketplace
are fetched anonymously from GitHub, so a private one is reported as not found or as
needing a GitHub sign-in; a source on any other host is not fetched here, and the
report notes that it will be checked when the marketplace actually synchronizes.

Nothing is recorded on the Compliance API activity feed.

For a worked example, see [Validate marketplace content](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/plugins-api?sdk_languages=python#validate-marketplace-content)
in the Plugins API guide.

**Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `read:plugins` or `write:plugins` scope; `read:org_audit` and `read:compliance_org_data` do not grant it.

Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.

### Parameters

- `repository_url: str`

  The `https://` URL of a public repository on github.com that holds the marketplace. A URL longer than 2,048 characters, on any other host or scheme, with a port other than 443 or 80, with credentials in it, or that does not name exactly `owner/repo` (a trailing `.git` or `/` is accepted) is a 400. A private or missing repository is reported in the response, not refused.

  minLength: 1

- `ref: Optional[str]`

  The branch to validate the tip of, or the full 40-character SHA of the commit to validate. When omitted, the branch a synchronization would read (usually the repository's default branch); if that is not the default branch, the report's `ref` says which branch was read. An empty string, a value longer than 255 characters, or one that contains `..` or a character other than ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, `+`, and `/`, is a 400. Any other value that is not a 40-character SHA is read as a branch name; if the repository has no such branch, the response is a report with `valid: false`, not a 400.

  minLength: 1

- `betas: Optional[List[AnthropicBetaParam]]` (header parameter)

  This endpoint is in beta: requests must send `ce-plugins-2026-09-01` in this header.

### Returns

- `class BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationReport`

  The outcome of validating plugin marketplace content: a report, not a
  stored object, so nothing in it can be retrieved afterwards.

    Always `plugin_marketplace_validation_report`.

    default: plugin_marketplace_validation_report

  - `commit_sha: Optional[str]`

    The full SHA of the commit that was validated: for a repository, the commit that was read; for an uploaded archive, the commit recorded in the archive's comment (as a Git host's download writes it; not verified), else null.

  - `manifest_error: Optional[str]`

    Set when nothing could be validated: the repository or archive could not be read, or marketplace.json is missing, malformed or over a limit. Null otherwise.

  - `manifest_error_code: Optional[str]`

    A stable identifier for `manifest_error`; null when that is.

  - `plugin_errors: List[BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginError]`

    One entry per plugin a synchronization would skip entirely, keyed by the plugin's name in marketplace.json.

    - `error: str`

      Why the plugin would be skipped by a synchronization.

    - `error_code: str`

      A stable identifier for the reason — the value to branch on.

    - `name: str`

      The plugin's name, as its entry in marketplace.json declares it.

  - `plugin_warnings: List[BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginWarnings]`

    One entry per plugin that would synchronize with some of its contents left out, keyed by the plugin's name in marketplace.json.

    - `name: str`

      The plugin's name, as its entry in marketplace.json declares it.

    - `warnings: List[BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginWarning]`

      The parts of the plugin a synchronization would leave out.

      - `error_code: str`

        A stable identifier for the kind of warning.

      - `message: str`

        What would be left out, and why.

  - `ref: Optional[str]`

    For a repository, the branch that was read by name: the one requested, or else the branch a synchronization of this repository is set to read. Null when no branch is named or set and the repository's default branch was read, for a request by commit SHA, and for an uploaded archive.

  - `total_plugin_count: int`

    How many plugins marketplace.json declares; 0 when it could not be read.

  - `valid: bool`

    True when marketplace.json is well-formed and no plugin would be skipped; warnings never make it false.

## Validate Plugin Marketplace Archive

`beta.organization.plugin_marketplaces.validate_archive(**kwargs) -> BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationReport`

**POST** `/v1/organizations/plugin_marketplaces/validate_archive`

Check whether a plugin marketplace, uploaded as a `.zip` of the marketplace
directory, would synchronize into claude.ai, without connecting or storing it.

To check a public GitHub repository instead, use Validate Plugin Marketplace Repository.

The report says whether `marketplace.json` is well-formed, which plugins a
synchronization would skip and why, and which plugins would synchronize only in
part, with some files left out. An archive that cannot be read as a marketplace is reported, not refused: the response is a report with `valid: false`. Plugin sources outside the marketplace
are fetched anonymously from GitHub, so a private one is reported as not found or as
needing a GitHub sign-in; a source on any other host is not fetched here, and the
report notes that it will be checked when the marketplace actually synchronizes.

Nothing is recorded on the Compliance API activity feed.

For a worked example, see [Validate marketplace content](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/plugins-api?sdk_languages=python#validate-marketplace-content)
in the Plugins API guide.

**Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `read:plugins` or `write:plugins` scope; `read:org_audit` and `read:compliance_org_data` do not grant it.

Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.

### Parameters

- `archive: FileTypes`

  A .zip of the marketplace directory (its contents at the root, or wrapped in one folder as a Git host's download produces), sent as a file part with a filename; DEFLATE- or STORE-compressed, at most 32 MB. A part sent without a filename, a second archive part, or any other form field is a 400; a larger archive is a 413.

  format: binary

Null until a synchronization is first attempted — so always for a `manual` plugin marketplace.

    - `"failed_auth"`

    - `"failed_content"`

    - `"failed_limits"`

    - `"failed_transient"`

    - `"in_progress"`

    - `"success"`

### Beta Plugin Marketplace Validation Plugin Error

- `class BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginError`

  - `error: str`

    Why the plugin would be skipped by a synchronization.

  - `error_code: str`

    A stable identifier for the reason — the value to branch on.

  - `name: str`

    The plugin's name, as its entry in marketplace.json declares it.

### Beta Plugin Marketplace Validation Plugin Warning

- `class BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginWarning`

  - `error_code: str`

    A stable identifier for the kind of warning.

  - `message: str`

    What would be left out, and why.

### Beta Plugin Marketplace Validation Plugin Warnings

- `class BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginWarnings`

  - `name: str`

    The plugin's name, as its entry in marketplace.json declares it.

  - `warnings: List[BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginWarning]`

    The parts of the plugin a synchronization would leave out.

    - `error_code: str`

      A stable identifier for the kind of warning.

    - `message: str`

      What would be left out, and why.

### Beta Plugin Marketplace Validation Report

- `class BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationReport`

  The outcome of validating plugin marketplace content: a report, not a
  stored object, so nothing in it can be retrieved afterwards.

  - `type: Literal["plugin_marketplace_validation_report"]`

    Always `plugin_marketplace_validation_report`.

    default: plugin_marketplace_validation_report

  - `commit_sha: Optional[str]`

    The full SHA of the commit that was validated: for a repository, the commit that was read; for an uploaded archive, the commit recorded in the archive's comment (as a Git host's download writes it; not verified), else null.

  - `manifest_error: Optional[str]`

    Set when nothing could be validated: the repository or archive could not be read, or marketplace.json is missing, malformed or over a limit. Null otherwise.

  - `manifest_error_code: Optional[str]`

    A stable identifier for `manifest_error`; null when that is.

  - `plugin_errors: List[BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginError]`

    One entry per plugin a synchronization would skip entirely, keyed by the plugin's name in marketplace.json.

    - `error: str`

      Why the plugin would be skipped by a synchronization.

    - `error_code: str`

      A stable identifier for the reason — the value to branch on.

    - `name: str`

      The plugin's name, as its entry in marketplace.json declares it.

  - `plugin_warnings: List[BetaPluginMarketplaceValidationPluginWarnings]`

    One entry per plugin that would synchronize with some of its contents left out, keyed by the plugin's name in marketplace.json.

    - `name: str`

        A stable identifier for the kind of warning.

      - `message: str`

        What would be left out, and why.

  - `ref: Optional[str]`

    For a repository, the branch that was read by name: the one requested, or else the branch a synchronization of this repository is set to read. Null when no branch is named or set and the repository's default branch was read, for a request by commit SHA, and for an uploaded archive.

  - `total_plugin_count: int`

    How many plugins marketplace.json declares; 0 when it could not be read.

  - `valid: bool`

    True when marketplace.json is well-formed and no plugin would be skipped; warnings never make it false.
